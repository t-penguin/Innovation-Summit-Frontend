# Capstone II Frontend

This project uses React and React-Router to display a Single-Page App.

## Getting Started

This app works best in conjunction with a Capstone II Backend. Go to that repo and get it up and running so that this Frontend has an API to request data from.

With that done, run the following commands:

1. Clone or fork this repository on GitHub.
2. Install the NPM packages: `npm install`
3. Preview your React app: `npm run start-dev`

You should be able to deploy this application to Vercel by simply connecting the GitHub repo to a new Vercel project. You will also need to configure the `API_URL` environment variable on Vercel to match the deployed API url for your backend. Likewise, you may need to configure the `FRONTEND_URL` environment varialbe on your Backend to match the deployed URL for this app.
